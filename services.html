                        An important part of getting your legal work done is having reliable document scanning services. At Orange Document Services, we create digitized files to help you do your 
                        legal work. As we scan, we make sure the files created are in whichever format will fit the needs of your project best. Files can be scanned as TIFF, PDF, or Concordance, 
                        among other file types.
                        <br>
                        With Orange Document Services, onsite scanning is available. When it comes to legal documents, we know that many documents cannot leave the company premises or may need 
                        specific supervision. With our on-site scanning services, we can send one of our professional document technicians to your location and provide our document scanning 
                        services on the spot.
                        <br>
                        This on-site service is particularly useful for document scanning, but we can arrange some other on-site services as needed.
