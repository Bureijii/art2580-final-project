                        An important part of getting your legal work done is having reliable document scanning services. At Orange Document Services, we create digitized files to help you do 
                        your legal work. As we scan, we make sure the files created are in whichever format will fit the needs of your project best. Files can be scanned as TIFF, PDF, or 
                        Concordance, among other file types.<br><br>With Orange Document Services, onsite scanning is available. When it comes to legal documents, we know that many documents 
                        cannot leave the company premises or may need specific supervision. With our on-site scanning services, we can send one of our professional document technicians to 
                        your location and provide our document scanning services on the spot.<br><br>This on-site service is particularly useful for document scanning, but we can arrange some 
                        other on-site services as needed.
